# Bootstrap-Extend

A few useful extensions for the very popular [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

For information on the components, as well as a live demo of the components, check out the [Bootstrap-Extend page](https://chalarangelo.github.io/bootstrap-extend/).

## Dependencies and Installation

This framework depends heavily on jQuery and Bootstrap 3. Include them in your `<head>` before it. Use the following two lines to include **Bootstrap-Extend** in your page:
`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/Chalarangelo/bootstrap-extend/master/js/bootstrap-extend.min.js"></script>`
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/Chalarangelo/bootstrap-extend/master/css/bootstrap-extend.min.css"/>`
