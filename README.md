# Bootstrap-Extend v1.1

A set of useful extensions for the very popular [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

## Live Demo and Documentation

For information on the components, as well as a live demo of the components, check out the [Bootstrap-Extend page](https://chalarangelo.github.io/bootstrap-extend/).

## Dependencies and Installation

This framework depends heavily on jQuery (2.2.4 or newer) and Bootstrap 3 (currently supported 3.3.6 and 3.3.7). Include them in your `<head>` before it. Use the following two lines to include **Bootstrap-Extend** in your page for **v1.1**:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/Chalarangelo/bootstrap-extend/880420ae663f7c539971ded33411cdecffcc2134/js/bootstrap-extend.min.js"></script>`

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/Chalarangelo/bootstrap-extend/880420ae663f7c539971ded33411cdecffcc2134/css/bootstrap-extend.min.css"/>`
